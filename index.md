## About Me
**Dr Kelvin Wong CGeog(GIS) FRGS** is a Senior Product Manager at [Risk Management Solutions (RMS)](https://www.rms.com/). He holds an Engineering Doctorate degree in 3D Geographic Information Science from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) in the United Kingdom, where he also completed his MSc in Geographic Information Science and MRes in Virtual Environments, Imaging and Visualisations. He completed his BSc in Geography at the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/). After completing his doctorate, he was awarded a [Postdoctoral Fellowship for Research in Japan](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-fellow/) from the [Japan Society for the Promotion of Science](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/) to conduct research on intelligent transport systems at the [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/). He is a [Chartered Geographer](https://www.rgs.org/professionals/chartered-geographer/) and Fellow of [The Royal Geographical Society](https://www.rgs.org/).

Using science as a practical tool for solving real-life problems, his research to date applies to a wide range of domains, from autonomous vehicles to human behaviour understanding to transport planning. He believes in exploiting the latest technologies to develop data-driven, user-centric, and scalable solutions. At RMS, he works alongside a unique mix of climatologists, seismologists, and mathematicians to design the best user experience for market-leading catastrophe modelling applications.
